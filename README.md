### JSFuck for Python

**Site:** [pyfuck.com](https://pyfuck.com)

## About
Inspired by [jsfuck](https://jsfuck.com).

This is basically the equivalent of jsfuck, but for Python. All this does is takes Python code (or any string of text), and creates a line which will call the `exec()` function on a integer converted version of the original code.
